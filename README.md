### Overview

This app is created with MySQL2, Node, Express, Handlebars and Sequelize.

* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on waiting area -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
